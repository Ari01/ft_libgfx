42 School Graphics Custom Library

To make it easier to work with, I will be explaining and looking into the 42 School Graphics Library Minilibx.

Along with this goal I plan to create a set of tools that can used to make a few different types of programs.
Basing this off my previous library for ft_wireframe and some of the ideas going around here at the lab.

*This is on hold for the moment, so I can get the remaining experience to join the PHP piscine.*

## MiniLibX

The keystone of the graphics branch at 42 is learning to use MiniLibX

Besides some old videos on intra, you are given the source and the man pages to figure it out.

Let's demystify the man pages.

I took a moment and formatted them for markdown.

MiniLibX is described in the following man pages:

* [mlx](man_mlx.md) : MiniLibX overview

* [mlx_new_window](man_mlx_new_window.md) : manage windows

* [mlx_pixel_put](man_mlx_pixel_put.md) : draw inside window

* [mlx_new_image](man_mlx_new_image.md) : manipulate images

* [mlx_loop](man_mlx_loop.md) : handle keyboard or mouse events
